27/03/20, 7:44 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: It's the previous version before she told to make changes
27/03/20, 7:44 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: My analysis took 2 pages and I tried but there's nothing more that I can remove from analysis

27/03/20, 7:45 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: That's what she wants
27/03/20, 7:45 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: In analysis?
27/03/20, 7:45 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Tell me what to Reno
27/03/20, 7:45 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Remove*
27/03/20, 7:45 pm - Likith S R RV: Remove advantages
27/03/20, 7:45 pm - Likith S R RV: Important concepts
27/03/20, 7:45 pm - Likith S R RV: Hierarchy
27/03/20, 7:46 pm - Likith S R RV: First 2 images you remove

27/03/20, 7:46 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: In analysis, I'm only analyzing a part cause the whole algo is really really big
27/03/20, 7:46 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: To show that, I've given the hierarchy
27/03/20, 7:46 pm - Likith S R RV: Oh idk then
27/03/20, 7:46 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: It's some dumb thing
27/03/20, 7:47 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: She just wants it for the sake of it
27/03/20, 7:47 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Nobody really expects us to learn in these projects
27/03/20, 7:47 pm - Likith S R RV: Obviously they expect us to

27/03/20, 7:50 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: 🙌🏻
27/03/20, 8:00 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Analysis should be done after implementation.
Blindly people are copying and pasting.

01/04/20, 10:41 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: wth
01/04/20, 10:42 pm - Amaan RV CS: nptel i'm talking about
01/04/20, 10:42 pm - Likith S R RV: just keep trying youll get
01/04/20, 10:42 pm - Likith S R RV: Explanation 1 : We will solve this using MST Cycle property, which says that, "For any cycle C in the graph, if the weight of an edge e of C is larger than the weights of all other edges of C, then this edge cannot belong to an MST."
Step 1
Run dfs from one of the end-points(either u or v) of the edge E considering only those edges that have weight less than that of E.
Step 2
Case 1 If at the end of this dfs, the vertices u and v get connected, then edge E cannot be a part of some MST. This is because in this case there definitely exists a cycle in the graph with the edge E having the maximum weight and it cannot be a part of the MST(from the cycle property).
Case 2 But if at the end of the dfs u and v stay disconnected, then edge E must be the part of some MST as in this case E is always not the maximum weight edge in all the cycles that it is a part of.
01/04/20, 10:42 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Keep submitting
01/04/20, 10:43 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Damn bro
01/04/20, 10:43 pm - Amaan RV CS: fuckk
01/04/20, 10:43 pm - Likith S R RV: Explanation 2 : By negating the weights, observe that it is equivalent to finding the maximum-weight feedback edge set. To find a maximum-weight feedback edge set, build an MST using either Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm. Then take the complement of that MST to obtain minimum weight feedback edge set.
01/04/20, 10:43 pm - Likith S R RV: eh i compiled from various sources lmao

05/04/20, 3:59 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: i am plotting 2 graphs
05/04/20, 3:59 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: but only 1 is getting printed
05/04/20, 4:00 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: any sol?
05/04/20, 4:00 pm - Amaan RV CS: check semicolons
05/04/20, 4:00 pm - Kruthik Rvce: <Media omitted>
05/04/20, 4:00 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: there's no semicolon anywhere
05/04/20, 4:01 pm - Amaan RV CS: then no idea
05/04/20, 4:01 pm - Kruthik Rvce: <Media omitted>

05/04/20, 4:01 pm - Kruthik Rvce: No
05/04/20, 4:01 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: both should print no
05/04/20, 4:01 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: since we are plotting both
05/04/20, 4:02 pm - Likith S R RV: show code
05/04/20, 4:02 pm - Kruthik Rvce: .
05/04/20, 4:03 pm - Likith S R RV: both are printing yeah
05/04/20, 4:03 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: but for me only one is printing
05/04/20, 4:03 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: individually is i plot both would print
05/04/20, 4:03 pm - Likith S R RV: maybe its not shown there because space is not sufficient maybe
05/04/20, 4:03 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: but if i plot both it will only plot 1
05/04/20, 4:04 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: oh
05/04/20, 4:10 pm - Kruthik Rvce: did u submit ?
05/04/20, 4:14 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: No
05/04/20, 4:53 pm - Amaan RV CS: i submitted
05/04/20, 4:53 pm - Amaan RV CS: 3/5
05/04/20, 4:53 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Tf
05/04/20, 4:53 pm - Amaan RV CS: i think she'll probably change it later
05/04/20, 4:53 pm - Amaan RV CS: if we ask doubts
05/04/20, 4:54 pm - Amaan RV CS: because it is right
05/04/20, 4:54 pm - Manoj Rvce: Dude wens the deadline
By the end of the day?
05/04/20, 4:54 pm - Amaan RV CS: G1 = graph([1 1 2 2 3 3 4],[2 4 3 5 4 5 5]);
G1.Nodes.Name={'a' 'b' 'c' 'd' 'e'}';
plot(G1,'XData',[2 3 2 1 2],'YData',[3 2 1 2 2])

05/04/20, 4:56 pm - Amaan RV CS: yep
05/04/20, 4:57 pm - Manoj Rvce: Many are getting 3
05/04/20, 4:57 pm - Manoj Rvce: So do it properly lol
05/04/20, 4:58 pm - Manoj Rvce: There are errors if you get the format  incorrect and all
05/04/20, 4:58 pm - Manoj Rvce: But we can probably ask the tecaher if the graph is correct no
05/04/20, 4:59 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Yeah
05/04/20, 4:59 pm - Amaan RV CS: <Media omitted>
05/04/20, 5:00 pm - Amaan RV CS: yea !!

05/04/20, 5:10 pm - Amaan RV CS: 😂
05/04/20, 5:10 pm - Amaan RV CS: I don't remember if it was for semicolons tho
05/04/20, 5:11 pm - Amaan RV CS: It was similar to this. Error in storing values. But the remaining operations worked
05/04/20, 6:02 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: When's the last date for DAA lab assignment

07/04/20, 2:27 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: <Media omitted>
07/04/20, 2:27 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: <Media omitted>
07/04/20, 2:27 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Skanda and Kriti did
07/04/20, 2:28 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: I'm trying to do this way itself
07/04/20, 2:28 pm - Likith S R RV: in the sense copy it and modify?
07/04/20, 2:28 pm - Likith S R RV: or from scratch
07/04/20, 2:28 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: It's written diagram so you have to draw from scratch
07/04/20, 2:29 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: You can do in Paint or come circuit simulation also
07/04/20, 2:28 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Oh fuck what is that
07/04/20, 2:29 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: But I couldn't find any free software with lpc2148
07/04/20, 2:29 pm - Likith S R RV: no da i meant all the modules and circuitry
07/04/20, 2:29 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Otherwise it would have been easy
07/04/20, 2:29 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Modules circuitry is pretty much same for everyone. Once a pin used, don't use it anywhere again. That's all ig
07/04/20, 2:30 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Isn't this thing available on internet?
07/04/20, 2:30 pm - Likith S R RV: so we just have to make it look like its new?
07/04/20, 2:30 pm - Likith S R RV: do on paint no?
07/04/20, 2:30 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Too much work
07/04/20, 2:31 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Drawing by hand is easier
07/04/20, 2:31 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: You can finish this in 5 minutes on Proteus but half the things are paid
07/04/20, 2:32 pm - Likith S R RV: do we have to implement this?
07/04/20, 2:32 pm - Likith S R RV: like in keil
07/04/20, 2:32 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Later. Not now
07/04/20, 2:32 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: He'll start that today evening
07/04/20, 2:32 pm - Likith S R RV: do we have marks for this?
07/04/20, 2:33 pm - Likith S R RV: main question
07/04/20, 2:33 pm - Kruthik Rvce: So drawing with hand only...
07/04/20, 2:33 pm - Manoj Rvce: Bro can't I just submit what you submit or should i redraw it all?
07/04/20, 2:33 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: yeah exactly since it'll be the same thing
07/04/20, 2:34 pm - Manoj Rvce: Bro how will we even study all this later on😂
07/04/20, 2:35 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Yeah I'm doing by hand
07/04/20, 2:35 pm - Likith S R RV: are you drawing the same thing?
07/04/20, 2:36 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: I rearranged things but mostly same. And you can't really draw any different apart from selecting different pins
07/04/20, 2:35 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: bro even if you redraw it'll be the same no
07/04/20, 2:36 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: what difference does that make
07/04/20, 2:36 pm - Likith S R RV: yeah thats what
07/04/20, 2:36 pm - Likith S R RV: but do we have marks for this?
07/04/20, 2:36 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Its the same components and same pin configuration
07/04/20, 2:36 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Idts
07/04/20, 2:36 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Yep
07/04/20, 2:37 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Both are the same no.. So u can draw any 1 of thy
07/04/20, 2:37 pm - Kruthik Rvce: That*
07/04/20, 2:38 pm - Manoj Rvce: Bro manja I iwll just redraw it by alligning it in a different way
07/04/20, 2:38 pm - Manoj Rvce: That will do it right?
07/04/20, 2:38 pm - Likith S R RV: +1
07/04/20, 2:39 pm - Amaan RV CS: Did he send any sheet till now to submit this

10/04/20, 10:59 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Which algorithm
10/04/20, 11:00 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: In geeks for geeks they said Branch and bound
10/04/20, 11:00 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: We'll write that only?
10/04/20, 11:00 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: @918310698913 please help
10/04/20, 11:00 pm - Manoj Rvce: i ahve put description for  A * and algo of priorit yqueue xD

10/04/20, 11:01 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Ya
10/04/20, 11:01 pm - Manoj Rvce: yea right this is for priority queue
10/04/20, 11:02 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Description u write for both ig
10/04/20, 11:02 pm - Manoj Rvce: the one above this is A*
10/04/20, 11:02 pm - Likith S R RV: I have a feeling she won't accept this
10/04/20, 11:02 pm - Kruthik Rvce: That is creating games no...
10/04/20, 11:02 pm - Likith S R RV: We haven't learnt about heuristics
10/04/20, 11:02 pm - Manoj Rvce: lets put both?
10/04/20, 11:03 pm - Manoj Rvce: dude she grades the 2nd time anyways if we get it worng
10/04/20, 11:03 pm - Kruthik Rvce: No da... Go through the other one it is only for creating a game
10/04/20, 11:03 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Then solving is priority queue thing
10/04/20, 11:04 pm - Manoj Rvce: aey idk da
10/04/20, 11:04 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: First question is backtracking right?

10/04/20, 11:06 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Yeah what do you mean by both?
10/04/20, 11:06 pm - Manoj Rvce: 😂
10/04/20, 11:06 pm - Manoj Rvce: both A* and priority queu
10/04/20, 11:06 pm - Likith S R RV: i put this not branch and bound
10/04/20, 11:06 pm - Likith S R RV: Technique applied : A* Algorithm (Combinatorial Optimization) and Priority Queues

You can use the heuristic that is based on the positions of the numbers, that is the higher the overall sum of all the distances of each letter from its goal state is, the higher the heuristic value. Then you can implement A* search which can be proved to be the optimal search in terms of time and space complexity 

We can order the moves with the help of a special queue that orders based on priority. The priority is determined by taking the current heuristic value and adding it to the depth. This gives us our A* (a star) value for a particular state. If the queue is ordered properly (lowest first), the next best move is always "next in line" for expansion. This process will always yield the correct solution in the least number of moves, as long as the puzzle is initially a solvable state.

The A* searching algorithm is a recursive algorithm that continuously calls itself until a winning state is found. When the game is designed, in order to randomly generate different games, start with the goal state and make many random moves on the state.



Algorithm PseudoCode :

 boolean
Solution::search(PriorityQueue pq)
{ if pq.isEmpty() then
	return false
puz = pq.extract()
if puz.isGoal()
	return true
successors = puz.expand()
            	// all possible successors to puz
for each suc in successors do
	pq.insert(suc)
if search(pq)
	return true
else
	return false
}

20/04/20, 12:20 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Bro today 5 pm there's nothing no?
20/04/20, 12:21 pm - Manoj Rvce: The password is set as”5555”.Henc, only when the user enters this key, the door will open.

void delay(): This is a function to generate delay of certain milliseconds.For loops are used to generate this delay.
 
The rows and columns of the keypad are defined.

int main(): The PLCLK is taken to be 60MHz. The direction is set for output in ports 1 and 0(pin 16 and pins 2,3,4,5,6,7,28,29,30,31 respectively). The first line’s position(0x80) is set using the cmd function and the user is asked to enter the password in order to enter inside. The second line’s position is set and the password entered is stored in an array rx_arr[]. The password is displayed as ”*” using the dat() method.Now, the password entered by the user is verified against the actual password and accordingly messages like”thank you”(for correct password) and” wrong password”are displayed in the second line(0xc0). If the user has entered the correct password, then lpc2148 sends signals to the motor driver which inturn signals the dc motor to rotate in clockwise direction using the forward() function, which opens the door. After which a certain delay is obtained using the delay() function and the dc motor stops rotating (stop()) . Later again, the message”come again” is displayed followed by a delay of a few milliseconds and lpc2148 sends signals to the motor driver which in turn signals the dc motor to rotate anticlockwise which closes the door and then stops rotating(stop()). If the password entered is wrong, then there is a delay of certain milliseconds and the screen is cleared(cmd(0x01)).

unsigned char keypad(): Here the row and column of the key entered by the user is decided using variables like r_loc and c_loc which store the row number and column number . Also, the variables c1,c2,c3 hold the addresses of the columns 1,2,3 respectively. Initially the column is decided using the if-else conditions. Pins 16,17,18,19 are used to decide the row.
Initially, pin 16 is cleared and the rest at set, check for the column is done, if either of the columns are cleared, r_loc=0, else next pin 17 is cleared and the rest are set, and again if either of the columns are cleared, r_loc=1, similarly 18,19 are cleared one after the other incase r_loc is still not found. Hence, after r_loc and c_loc are found, these positions are used to figure out the key from the 2D array defined at the start, and is returned.
Void lcd_init(): this method initialises the lcd i.e., sets the cursor position, sets the address of the first row etc.cmd(0x02);             //initialise lcd in 4bit mode
    cmd(0x28);                //2 lines on display
    cmd(0x0c);                //display on cursor off
    cmd(0x06);                //auto increment cursor
    cmd(0x80);                //first line position

void cmd(unsigned char a): The upper nibble of command is selected first, then pin 2 is cleared(rs=0 -> writing command byte into command register of LCD),pin 1 is cleared(rw=0 ->write command to LCD), and pin 3 is set (en=1, to perform writing/reading for 450nsec) and delay of certain milliseconds is obtained using lcd_delay() method to start with lower nibble. Also, pin 3 is cleared (en=0,perform read/write when pulse goes from high to low). Now, the lower nibble of command is selected, similar pins are set and cleared. Hence, using this method, the desired pins are set and cleared in order to write data.

void show(unsigned char *s): It gets the address of string to be displayed on lcd. Every character is extracted from the string and sent to the function dat() , in order to set and clear certain pins so that the string is displayed on lcd.

void dat(unsigned char b): It gets the character from show() method, it works similar to cmd function. But here instead of command, data is written. The upper nibble is selected and pin2 is set(rs=1, ->writing data into data register of lcd), pin1 is cleared(rw=0,->write data to lcd), pin 3 is set(en=1,->to perform read/write for 450nsec) after which delay is set using lcd_delay method. Now, the lower nibble is selected, pin2 is set(rs=1), pin 1 is cleared(rw=0), pin 3 is set(en=1). Hence, data is written on lcd.

void lcd_delay(): Here for loop is used to generate delay of certain milliseconds. Delay is essential as there should be some time gap between operations performed on upper nibble and lower nibble in order for them not to overlap which doesn’t give the desired output and also, so that the output is visible on the screen for some noticeable time.

void forward(): This method drives the  dc motor  to rotate in clockwise direction after receiving signals from the motor driver(l232d). Only when the user enters the correct password, the motor rotates in clockwise direction and the door opens. The pins 16 or 18 are set and pin 17 is cleared , to achieve this. 

Void reverse():this method drives the  dc motor  to rotate in anti- clockwise after receiving signals from the motor driver(l232d). Only when the user enters the correct password, the door opens and after that the dc motor rotates in an anti-clockwise direction to close the door. The pins 17 or 18 are set and pin 16 is cleared , to achieve this.
Void stop():here pin 18 is cleared. The method helps in stopping the rotation of the dc motor in both clockwise and anti-clockwise direction, once the door is open and closed respectively.
20/04/20, 12:21 pm - Manoj Rvce: Apparently explanation is somewhat loseely related to what he sent today

21/04/20, 4:31 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: See the sir's video for doing without them
21/04/20, 4:32 pm - Manoj Rvce: Hello sir this is  regarding the  quizzes which is being  scheduled from the 28th of this month.
We have all been sincerely attending the online classes but with the quizzes being scheduled in one week's time without any prior information seems unfair and quite a lot of pressure.
This month apart from the mounting fear from the  corona outbreak and many restrictions that came along with it, we were also loaded with assignments and projects for all  subjects some of which is still going on.
To prepare for all the 6 subjects 3 units each seems quite an ordeal.So we request you to extend the date of the quizzes or reduce the vastness of the syllabus that way we could efficently prepare for the quizzes instead of just skimming through the topics so we could cover the portions which seems cretinous.
We would be thankful if you consider this while giving out the schedule.
21/04/20, 4:32 pm - Manoj Rvce: Manja spam this
21/04/20, 4:32 pm - Amaan RV CS: someone put this on class grp

28/04/20, 11:38 am - Manoj Rvce: i mean i dont see how they will ask that
28/04/20, 11:38 am - Manoj Rvce: see its like they give a set of weights
28/04/20, 11:38 am - Manoj Rvce: and a max weight
28/04/20, 11:39 am - Manoj Rvce: you are supposed to tell if you add which weights you will get that max weight
28/04/20, 11:39 am - Manoj Rvce: its pretty strightforward

05/05/20, 5:10 pm - Amaan RV CS: A friend of mine made a teacher account and checked. 
You CANNOT switch tabs without the teacher knowing. 
Not even Virtual Desktop.

But there was no camera monitoring as much as he saw.
So usage of phone is plausible.

There is a way where the teachers can decide what PDFs you use as reference. They are able to add just those files onto lost of resources.

Programming option is there, but C or Java isn't available so GG.

You can either type, or write on A4 and scan. Depending on the paper.

09/05/20, 5:11 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: ohhh
09/05/20, 5:12 pm - Amaan RV CS: A few colleges have given 70% weightage to assignments and 30% to tests.
And they've used minimal tests to get that 30%
Quizzes make up exactly 30% of our marks anyway
One test is about 17%
You can make it 50-50 and we'll all be happy.
And for lab subjects, program submissions and vivas are done.
So, out of 150, 40(lab), 30(quiz) and 20(test) are done.
 That's 90/150 already done.
09/05/20, 5:13 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: i dont think our college will listen
09/05/20, 5:13 pm - Amaan RV CS: What if the percentage of test marks increases

09/05/20, 5:13 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: oh okay yeah makes sense

09/05/20, 5:14 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: if there's one thing i've learned in this college
09/05/20, 5:14 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: its that they dont care about what students want
09/05/20, 5:14 pm - Amaan RV CS: And bio tho is fucked only

I'm sure you're aware of how the college management is a little unaware of the real ground situation. So some of us decided to make this survey to tell them what the real situation is.

This survey contains questions regarding *availability of resources* and *your situation* . Please *fill it truthfully* and *spread it as much as possible* so that we get the management aware of the actual situation ASAP.

10/05/20, 9:54 pm - Manoj Rvce: Okay ... So this is happening

The teachers are calling for a meeting with the students. Each class with teachers and students on zoom. This happened already in IEM today. 

The teachers are just sugar coating everything, And putting things in a way that every one gets convinced, And we feel they are the best, And they care for us. They are very good at this shit

They have been given orders to do so. Our Dept also called meeting tomorrow after noon, Slowly all departments will do this. 

Just keep the class prepared and tell them to speak up about the problems they have, And not just get convinced. If they fail to express here then college will say we did a survey And we found out no one has problems. 

So if anyone has a problem with the upcoming CIE’s, be it internet connectivity or lack of devices or whatsoever, pls speak up in the meeting that your teachers will be keeping.

17/05/20, 4:41 pm - Likith S R RV: Like that akarsh guy from spark
17/05/20, 4:43 pm - Amaan RV CS: Wait what
17/05/20, 4:43 pm - Amaan RV CS: How tf?
17/05/20, 4:45 pm - Likith S R RV: Like that cool English
17/05/20, 4:46 pm - Likith S R RV: All hifi words he's using
17/05/20, 6:00 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: <Media omitted>
17/05/20, 6:00 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Can someone tell what the cut is here?
17/05/20, 6:01 pm - Likith S R RV: whats the max flow?
17/05/20, 6:01 pm - Likith S R RV: 14?
17/05/20, 6:02 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Yeah
17/05/20, 6:03 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: But I'm not getting what cut have they taken
17/05/20, 6:03 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Can you draw and send
17/05/20, 6:04 pm - Manoj Rvce: Bro why can't you use that website
17/05/20, 6:04 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: That website doesn't tell cut
17/05/20, 6:04 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: What if they ask cut set
17/05/20, 6:05 pm - Manoj Rvce: <Media omitted>
17/05/20, 6:05 pm - Likith S R RV: <Media omitted>
17/05/20, 6:05 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: How is that a cut
17/05/20, 6:05 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: A cut has to be continuous no
17/05/20, 6:05 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: <Media omitted>
17/05/20, 6:05 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Like this
17/05/20, 6:06 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: <Media omitted>
17/05/20, 6:06 pm - Manoj Rvce: See this will be the graph no
You take all the highlighted ones
17/05/20, 6:06 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: You can't do that
17/05/20, 6:06 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: <Media omitted>
17/05/20, 6:07 pm - Manoj Rvce: Okay use the python code
17/05/20, 6:07 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Ayy but  still
17/05/20, 6:07 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Doesn't a cut have to be continuous
17/05/20, 6:07 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: How's that a cut
17/05/20, 6:07 pm - Likith S R RV: one sec i think i made a mistake
17/05/20, 6:08 pm - Kruthik Rvce: In this 6,0 3,7 2,5 1,4
17/05/20, 6:08 pm - Kruthik Rvce: These the edges for the cut set
17/05/20, 6:08 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Macha your cut is correct
17/05/20, 6:08 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: 1,5 also
17/05/20, 6:09 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Ya
17/05/20, 6:09 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: How
17/05/20, 6:09 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Did you know
17/05/20, 6:09 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: @918310698913 your cut is correct but my question is, we gotta make a cut in one strike of a pen right as in it has to be continuous
17/05/20, 6:10 pm - Likith S R RV: i dont think thats the definition
17/05/20, 6:11 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Then how do you see a cut?
17/05/20, 6:14 pm - Likith S R RV: not sure lemme research
17/05/20, 6:14 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Cool
17/05/20, 6:15 pm - Likith S R RV: the thing is the video i watched said that cut edges so that there is no flow possible
17/05/20, 6:15 pm - Likith S R RV: and the minimm possible cut you make is the max flow
17/05/20, 6:19 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Ya
17/05/20, 6:20 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: This message was deleted
17/05/20, 6:20 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: This message was deleted
17/05/20, 6:20 pm - Kruthik Rvce: When flow is full it is a cut set
17/05/20, 6:20 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Ok kinda makes sense
17/05/20, 6:22 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Bro in the doc that soumya classroom has
17/05/20, 6:22 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: She's written all cut sets
17/05/20, 6:22 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: <Media omitted>
17/05/20, 6:22 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Like this
17/05/20, 6:22 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: But if such a big graph is there how will we write i mean its just insane some cut sets we can't even see
17/05/20, 6:23 pm - Kruthik Rvce: I think we just write the cut set with max flow
17/05/20, 6:24 pm - Kruthik Rvce: And cut set can also  be edges that disconnect source frm destination
17/05/20, 6:27 pm - Kruthik Rvce: WAT  all is there in greedy algo and scheduling problem
17/05/20, 6:27 pm - Kruthik Rvce: ?
17/05/20, 6:33 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: <Media omitted>
17/05/20, 6:33 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Someone solve this
17/05/20, 6:33 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: And tell ans
17/05/20, 6:33 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Along with how to do
17/05/20, 6:35 pm - Kruthik Rvce: https://youtu.be/-Q3__TyDayI
17/05/20, 6:36 pm - Kruthik Rvce: I think this how we have to do...
17/05/20, 6:37 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: solution send maadi
17/05/20, 6:43 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Is it 21...?
17/05/20, 6:43 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Legend
17/05/20, 6:43 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Yes
17/05/20, 6:43 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: How?
17/05/20, 6:45 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Consider only the edges where each vertex is source set and destination set
17/05/20, 6:46 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Not the vertices where both vertices is in same set
17/05/20, 7:00 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Here also every cut made is continous only
17/05/20, 7:01 pm - Manoj Rvce: eh bro you stfu abt your continous BS😂
17/05/20, 7:02 pm - Kruthik Rvce: I didn't get it...
17/05/20, 7:03 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Like here also they've made a cut in one single strike
17/05/20, 7:03 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: This cut you can't make in a single strike without cutting other edges
17/05/20, 7:04 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Bro suppose tomorrow you put all cutsets according to you but there are more invisible cut sets, what will you do
17/05/20, 7:05 pm - Kruthik Rvce: The thing is the source and destination should be disconnected... I don't think it matters if it is continuous or not
17/05/20, 7:05 pm - Manoj Rvce: dude een this is one single solution only no
17/05/20, 7:06 pm - Manoj Rvce: like we prevent the flow from source getting to destination is what i understood
17/05/20, 7:06 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: <Media omitted>
17/05/20, 7:06 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: This cut will be like this... You only tell how to join
17/05/20, 7:08 pm - Manoj Rvce: dude maybe it being continours apllies to only few cases not all
17/05/20, 7:08 pm - Manoj Rvce: see this makes sense if you take that example
17/05/20, 7:08 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Ohh
17/05/20, 7:08 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: But bro how will we see it for a question
17/05/20, 7:08 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Like analysis only is taking time
17/05/20, 7:08 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Idk how I will see this
17/05/20, 7:08 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Atleast making cut was easy you could just do 2 partitions
17/05/20, 7:09 pm - Manoj Rvce: the cut set to get max flow is fine
17/05/20, 7:09 pm - Manoj Rvce: even am not sure how we will be getting the other ones
17/05/20, 7:09 pm - Manoj Rvce: like the ones that dont lead to max fliw
17/05/20, 7:09 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Yeah
17/05/20, 7:20 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Matching is not there in syllabus no
17/05/20, 7:39 pm - Likith S R RV: No
17/05/20, 8:52 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Boys
17/05/20, 8:52 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: What plans for tomorrow before exam
17/05/20, 8:52 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Should someone put instructions again on the group like last time?
17/05/20, 9:10 pm - Amaan RV CS: Yea remind everyone
17/05/20, 9:10 pm - Amaan RV CS: @917790833943
17/05/20, 9:10 pm - Amaan RV CS: About the WhatsApp groups thing
17/05/20, 9:10 pm - Likith S R RV: What's the plan?
17/05/20, 9:10 pm - Amaan RV CS: Also we'll be on call
17/05/20, 9:10 pm - Likith S R RV: Like we paste pic of qp and link to WhatsApp
17/05/20, 9:10 pm - Likith S R RV: So there will be 6 links on that group rt?
17/05/20, 9:10 pm - Amaan RV CS: Yes
17/05/20, 9:11 pm - Amaan RV CS: Or maybe the code will be sufficient
17/05/20, 9:11 pm - Likith S R RV: Imagine 5 questions 5 people will solve separately
17/05/20, 9:11 pm - Likith S R RV: And everyone can merge later
17/05/20, 9:11 pm - Likith S R RV: 15 minutes exam will get over lol
17/05/20, 9:11 pm - Amaan RV CS: Yea dude this is like the best thing that can happen
17/05/20, 9:12 pm - Amaan RV CS: All we have to do is write those answers in sheets
17/05/20, 9:12 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Yeah
17/05/20, 9:13 pm - Likith S R RV: Also if your paper is not on group you post a pic of your qp and make a group and share link
17/05/20, 9:13 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Ayy what all to send
17/05/20, 9:13 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Write a single message
17/05/20, 9:13 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: I'll fwd
17/05/20, 9:14 pm - Kruthik Rvce: WAT  all is there in greedy algo and scheduling problem
17/05/20, 9:14 pm - Kruthik Rvce: ?
17/05/20, 9:14 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Someone tell this
17/05/20, 9:14 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Where to do  this frm.?
17/05/20, 9:15 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: https://youtu.be/vGjsi8NIpSE
17/05/20, 9:15 pm - Likith S R RV: As soon as exam starts let's post a Pic of our question paper with a group link, if you're paper is not there make a group and share the link.

You can split up the questions once a group is formed I.e each one can solve a single question and all of you can merge later, this way it'll be very efficient
17/05/20, 9:16 pm - Likith S R RV: Add more poings  to this if you want to
17/05/20, 9:16 pm - Likith S R RV: This is incase we can't find our groups before the exam I.e if code is unique to everyone
17/05/20, 9:50 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: We gonna be on zoom tmr?
17/05/20, 9:51 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Peace
17/05/20, 9:54 pm - Manoj Rvce: yes yes
17/05/20, 10:58 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: What picture are we supposed to upload before the exam?
17/05/20, 10:58 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: From webcam uh?
17/05/20, 10:59 pm - Manoj Rvce: we should ah?
17/05/20, 10:59 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Yeah there were some instrictions no?
17/05/20, 10:59 pm - Amaan RV CS: Ehh nope not required
17/05/20, 11:00 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Idk bro in ISE the hod told itbseems
17/05/20, 11:00 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: It seems*
17/05/20, 11:02 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Yeah top right of the page I think
17/05/20, 11:03 pm - Amaan RV CS: Can we reize and adjust the uploaded pics
17/05/20, 11:03 pm - Amaan RV CS: How from webcam
17/05/20, 11:03 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: How?

17/05/20, 11:04 pm - Manjunath S Nayak: Yeah thid
17/05/20, 11:04 pm - Likith S R RV: use the same pic for all exams
17/05/20, 11:05 pm - Amaan RV CS: I don't think I have any passport pics here. They're in hostel
17/05/20, 11:06 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: wait i dont have a passport sized pic
17/05/20, 11:06 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: so what are you supposed to start your paper with a photo eh
17/05/20, 11:06 pm - Kruthik Rvce: On all sheets ahh...
17/05/20, 11:07 pm - Amaan RV CS: On one sheet da
17/05/20, 11:07 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: how do i get a photo
17/05/20, 11:07 pm - Amaan RV CS: +1
17/05/20, 11:07 pm - Manoj Rvce: dont think they will harass you over that
17/05/20, 11:08 pm - Manoj Rvce: idk dude just take a picture of yourself on your mobile and keep it as prrog somewhere
17/05/20, 11:08 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: ah cool
17/05/20, 11:09 pm - Likith S R RV: just scan a pic and upload
17/05/20, 11:09 pm - Likith S R RV: place it on top right corner
17/05/20, 11:10 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Can you minimise and all there?
17/05/20, 11:12 pm - Likith S R RV: yes
17/05/20, 11:20 pm - Amaan RV CS: Ohcoolh
17/05/20, 11:49 pm - Likith S R RV: You guys writing in sheets and uploading later
17/05/20, 11:49 pm - Likith S R RV: Or writing in that answer area. Directly?
17/05/20, 11:49 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Writing in sheets
17/05/20, 11:50 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Uploading on the link they provide using camscanner
17/05/20, 11:50 pm - Likith S R RV: Will it get locked if you are inactive for a long time
17/05/20, 11:50 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Don't think so
17/05/20, 11:50 pm - Likith S R RV: Oh so no exam.net uploading?
17/05/20, 11:50 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Yes
17/05/20, 11:50 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: I dont think so
17/05/20, 11:51 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Camscanner is easier I feel
17/05/20, 11:51 pm - Likith S R RV: So I press soem keys in the middle so that it doesn't get locked?
17/05/20, 11:51 pm - Kruthik Rvce: U should keep moving cursor once in a while
17/05/20, 11:51 pm - Kruthik Rvce: Ya
17/05/20, 11:51 pm - Likith S R RV: Oh okk
17/05/20, 11:51 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Wbu
17/05/20, 11:52 pm - Likith S R RV: I'm uploading on exam.net
17/05/20, 11:52 pm - Likith S R RV: If they give link I'll probably upload there also lol
17/05/20, 11:53 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: You dont have to do twice nigga😂
17/05/20, 11:53 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: They are giving that link in case exam.net takes tine
17/05/20, 11:53 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Time *
17/05/20, 11:53 pm - Manoj Rvce: Dude math mam has told upload on the link preferably
17/05/20, 11:54 pm - Likith S R RV: so we submit an empty exam.net paper right?
17/05/20, 11:54 pm - Manoj Rvce: Yep
17/05/20, 11:54 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Yeah
17/05/20, 11:55 pm - Likith S R RV: what about extra time
17/05/20, 11:55 pm - Likith S R RV: like the juniors had right
17/05/20, 11:55 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: We don't have any timer no
17/05/20, 11:55 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: We can submit half an hour late also ig
17/05/20, 11:55 pm - Likith S R RV: does it auto submit or something
17/05/20, 11:55 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Nope
17/05/20, 11:56 pm - Likith S R RV: even the google link will probably expire at 1pm maybe
17/05/20, 11:56 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: Till 1 is the test only da
17/05/20, 11:56 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: 15 mins they're giving to upload
17/05/20, 11:56 pm - Mridul Mohta RV CS: That means the link should atleast be there till 1:15 if not more

1) direct promotion of all students to next sem
2) extending the exam dates for abt a mnth and givin exams after satisfactory online classes

04/06/20, 2:39 pm - Amaan RV CS: If they conduct exams, our few rules should be taken & given granted only then we will give exams.

1. Buses should be provided all over Karnataka for free of cost for students in exam days

2. *Upcoming year College fees should be cut down by 50%*

3. *No students will pay examination fees & for revaluation & photocopy for current semester.*

4. Every single student should be provided with N95 mask & sanitizer.

5. *Exam should be conducted for only 60% of syllabus or any 3/5 modules.*

6. The students who will come back to Karnataka or thode who are staying in Karnataka, if they tested positive their expenses should be beared by State govt.

7. Students should get atleast 4-6 weeks of teacher-student interaction or human interaction.

8. *If any of the student dies in Karnataka, their family should receive minimum amount of 3 Crore as compensation.*

If the State govt accepts this proposal, only then students will face exams, otherwise just promote students.

*Spread this message, and add on points if need. Share in every single media*
